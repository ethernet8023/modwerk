# Digitakt SDK

**Platform:** elemod · **OS:** 1.53 and 1.54 (mk1) · **Core:** 2.1 · **Modules:** [`sdk/digitakt/modules/`](../../digitakt/modules/) · **Status:** preview

Digitakt mods are linkable objects. One core patches the OS once at a few shared sites and calls every subscribed mod's handler, in order, from tables the linker builds. So any set of mods that fits the budgets combines. Modwerk builds them with its own TypeScript linker and OS writer, interoperable with the `.elemod` format. Building firmware in Modwerk is in development, so the machine is in preview.

## Create a mod

```sh
npm run module:new -- my-mod --machine digitakt --author your-github-login
```

This creates `modwerk.module.json` (contract v3), `build.json`, `src/main.c`, README, TESTING, licence and a placeholder thumbnail. See [the SDK guide](../../../docs/SDK.md) for the contract and evidence tiers.

## Core events

Handlers use the C calling convention: arguments on the stack, d0–d1/a0–a1 free, the result in d0. Subscribe in `platform.events` and name each handler in `build.json`.

| Event | When | Handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ev_tick` | the UI's 30 Hz compose check | `void f(ctrl)`; set `ctrl+0x20` to recompose |
| `ev_draw` | after the OS draws the screen | `void f(bmp, ctrl)` |
| `ev_key` | a key event | `int f(brain, KeyEvent*)`; nonzero takes it |
| `ev_enc` | an encoder event | `int f(brain, EncoderEvent*)`; nonzero takes it |
| `ev_settings` | building the SETTINGS menu | `void f(menu)`; add rows with `core_additem(menu, row)` |
| `ev_render_in` / `ev_render_out` | entry and exit of the audio render | `void f(void)` |
| SRC machines | the table `core_machines`: new SRC machines in slots 4–7, treated by the OS like the stock machine they stand in for | — |

## Budgets

- **Shared mod memory:** 128 KiB of DDR (0x47BE0000–0x47C00000) for the core and every mod's code and data.
- **Fast SRAM:** 2,304 bytes (0x8000F700–0x80010000) for time-critical code.
- **SRC machine slots:** 4–7, one per new machine.

Claim named resources (a machine slot, a SETTINGS row, a SysEx id, a +Drive path) in `platform.claims`; two mods may never claim the same one.

## Toolchain

m68k-elf GCC and binutils for ColdFire, and elekloader's builder, which Modwerk runs in the browser for the launch ([vendor/elekloader](../../../vendor/elekloader/README.md)). Modwerk's own linker, OS writer and core are frozen until work resumes; the core's contract is [core/interface.json](../../digitakt/core/interface.json), and `npm run modules:check` rejects modules that use anything it does not provide.

## Flash and recover

Send the .syx with Elektron Transfer and confirm on the unit. If a custom OS will not start, hold FUNC while powering on, choose OS UPGRADE (TRIG 4) and send the stock .syx with Transfer's legacy OS upgrade mode.

The file format, memory map, core interface and hook bus were researched and published by [elekloader](https://github.com/irpina/elekloader) (irpina, GPL-2.0-or-later) and [digikit](https://github.com/m-dwyer/digikit) (Em D, GPL-2.0-or-later). The container and SysEx transport were first documented by [elektron-firmware-tool](https://github.com/mischa85/elektron-firmware-tool) (Marcel Bierling, MIT).
