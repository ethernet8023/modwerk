# Octamod SDK

The developer entry point for the Octamod monorepo. The SDK, module source, web content and configurator stay together. It derives from [octabam](https://github.com/sambanks/octabam); original MIT copyright and component credits are retained under `octabam/LICENSE` and `octabam/THIRD_PARTY.md`.

The initial import includes **Spectrum, Modulation, Character, Mini Verb, Tape Echo, Euclid and Repitch**. It comes from a fresh upstream clone pinned to the exact fork revision in [UPSTREAM.json](UPSTREAM.json). On 1 October 2026, the owner expanded scope to Analog BD, MIDI Scenes, USB Audio (tracks + MAIN/CUE) and Scale Quantizer. Their latest source import and author pins are recorded in [imports/octabam-363861e.json](imports/octabam-363861e.json). USB MIDI is included as an internal dependency. Further octabam modules remain outside scope. Its required stock-loader infrastructure is isolated under `octabam/platform/`, outside the public module catalog. Two supported compositions and the crowded-selection rejection match the native builder byte for byte; the copied upstream Makefile is not yet a supported standalone firmware build command.

## Start without firmware or native compilation

Use Node 24 from the monorepo root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run modules:check
npm run module:new -- my-filter --kind dsp --author your-github-login
```

Use `--kind coldfire` for a CPU contribution. The scaffolder refuses to overwrite an existing module. It creates source, `manifest.py`, versioned `octamod.module.json`, README, TESTING, licence and a media directory. DSP scaffolds use an example ID; select an unused ID and write actual gates before use. The generated native verification gate fails deliberately until it is replaced with meaningful module-specific checks. A scaffold never becomes an installed or published module automatically.

New modules and updates also require worst-case cycles under parameter modulation and maximum load, exact memory allocation accounting, and a passed stress project on real MKI/MKII hardware for at least one hour with all eight audio tracks active. Complete the scaffold's `qualification.example.json` with actual measurements/results, then copy that object into `tests.qualification`. Release also requires the complete README/TESTING/licence/control documentation, a short practical tutorial and real black-and-white PNG screenshots in the online style; yellow captures are rejected. Fill the template’s documentation section and synchronize its tutorial and screenshot paths with README. The incomplete template cannot pass checks. Read [the qualification gates and source-fingerprint procedure](../docs/MODULE_QUALIFICATION.md). Local, PR and release checks enforce the record without running native source; the owner verifies the actual reports before merge. The existing eleven module versions/folder contents remain exempt through a frozen baseline, while later updates must qualify.

Module folders are `sdk/octabam/modules/<id>/`. Website metadata is plain JSON, validated without evaluating Python. After editing a catalog module, increase its semantic version and update its exact version in `sdk/catalog.json`. Regenerate:

```sh
npm run modules:generate
npm run check
```

The eleven frontend pages read the generated catalog from these folders. Fields include controls, practical uses, compatibility, resource measurement methods/conditions, evidence revision, authors, licences and real media provenance. Read [the module contract](../docs/MODULE_REPOSITORIES.md) and [contribution rules](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Native development

Native source and reference tools are retained under `octabam/`, with historical namespace/path compatibility. Read `octabam/docs/remixer/MODULES.md` and `PLACEMENT.md` before altering memory claims. Do not execute uploaded or unreviewed manifests on a trusted workstation. Compilation must run in isolation without credentials; user firmware never enters automation.

The native toolchain requires Python 3.10+, CMake, a patched DSP56300 assembler/disassembler, GNU m68k-elf tools and locally supplied original OS 1.40C for composition and firmware-dependent gates. The platform migration has passed local native composition parity. Portable developer setup remains in progress; approved source-to-package automation compiles reviewed code in an isolated stock-free container. Emulator/stress checks require separate native qualification and are not run by `npm run check`. Compiled module code, packaging parity and hardware qualification are separate proofs.

Displaced ColdFire module/platform expectations and DSP hook expectations were changed to address/length/hash guards. The receiver’s nine-word stock null routine is recovered and relocated only at local build time, never retained in the SDK source. `stock_guard.py` reads and verifies the developer's own ignored local extraction; absent or altered firmware fails closed. A copied stock-label table was removed. No stock firmware, extracted output, submodule checkout, vendor binary or upstream Git history is imported. The remaining native tooling/source needs a provenance audit before SDK release. `npm run sdk:check` covers guarded reads using original synthetic fixtures, with no firmware or emulator input. `docs/VERIFICATION.md` records native parity separately.

## Verify native composition locally

With a locally patched toolchain and your own ignored original 1.40C extraction:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify-sdk-native.py --raw-os /local/path/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin --vendor /local/path/vendor
```

The recorded verification used a temporary SDK copy, verified the original seven public modules and the internal loader, compares two complete native-image hashes and the overcrowding rejection, then removes the temporary firmware-containing outputs. It does not run audio renders, stress tests or the emulator. It produces proof of composition, not hardware qualification or a flashable download. This historical verifier deliberately copies only the original seven modules and registers their two loader platform declarations. The requested loader-free integration is verified separately by the 288-profile comparison below; it never enables the dynamic loader. The copied upstream Makefile remains a reference until portable SDK setup and local packaging are finished. See [verification.json](verification.json) for the recorded identities.

## Versions and approval

Publication requires actual hardware/emulator LCD captures of the selection/enable location and relevant controls, plus exact access steps and version/build/setup provenance in the manifest. See [the capture workflow](../docs/MODULE_UI_CAPTURES.md). Empty screenshots are draft-only; automatic USB modules without OT UI need the narrow reviewer-verified `access.noUiReason` declaration.

Every module has a semantic version. Code, native declarations, web descriptions, controls, evidence or media changes require a strictly greater version. Patch versions suit compatible fixes; minor versions suit compatible additions; major versions identify changed stored parameter layouts, IDs or behavior requiring migration. Never reuse an already released version for different contents.

**The owner merging the PR is the approval.** There is no second website approval step. Require owner review and passing checks on the current PR revision before merge. Automation builds the merged source commit and records module versions, source and artifact identities. A failed build keeps the previous release available. Protect main against unreviewed direct changes before enabling publication.

## Requested source imports

Preview Vol, requested on 2 October 2026, is a [source draft](drafts/previewvol/README.md)
recovered from a pinned octamad snapshot. It makes sample previews use the
default AMP volume; upstream reports restoration of the track volume afterward.
The draft includes an original thumbnail, documentation and actual MKII emulator
UI captures. Missing resource/hardware qualification and owner verification keep
it outside native discovery, the public catalog and firmware packages. Its
import does not change the existing eleven-module qualification baseline.

The four additions have `0.1.1-experimental` manifests and exact per-module source pins. Native comparison matched 156 byte identities and 132 refusals across all 288 requested profiles. Actual-browser complete files matched native packaging for the six-module and Analog BD five-module combinations; altered firmware was rejected. Their pending build markers are removed. The release compiler builds all eleven reviewed modules, binds the full SDK source inventory and emits nine source-package artifacts. Inherited USB spans are zero placeholders; stock helpers and tables are derived only from the user’s fingerprinted local firmware. The importer and frontend-only stamp enforce current versions and the same artifact scope. Owner merge remains publication approval.

With Node 24 and your own original firmware kept outside the repository:

```sh
node scripts/verify-requested-native.mjs /local/path/OCTATRACK_OS1.40C.bin src/engine/assets/requested-composition-proofs.json
```

See [verification](../docs/VERIFICATION.md) for full-file identities and coverage limits.

MIDI Scenes vendors only its twelve required GNU assembly units, README and MIT licence from 1.40MIDISC8.2. Quantizer vendors only its v2.9 implementation, documentation and MIT licence. Neither imports the other modules in its author's repository. USB MIDI source is under `octabam/platform/usb-midi/` and registered internally; it is not a public catalog entry. The chosen USB Audio module sends twenty output channels at high speed, with no USB audio input.

Import validation is static: `npm run sdk:check` checks the recorded source hashes, stock guards, author pins and required dependency files without evaluating imported Python. Every embedded stock expectation in the new declarations was replaced with an address/length/hash guard; no stock routines or firmware outputs were copied. Each TESTING.md separates upstream historical evidence from verified Octamod composition/packaging from remaining hardware qualification. No DSP execution, emulator, audio-render or stress suite runs in the browser build flow.
