Shared dsp_asm/dsp56kDisassemble helper -- used by both build_sidechain_compressor.py's
sc_assemble() and emu_sc_dsp3.py's assemble() so the two never drift (same
rationale as sc_tables.py for the coefficient tables).

Session 76 continued yet again: both call sites used to find `rts` boundaries
by scanning raw 24-bit CODE WORDS for the literal value 0x00000c (rts's own
opcode encoding) -- but 0x00000c is also a perfectly ordinary DISPLACEMENT
for a 2-word `bra`/`bcc` (or an operand word for a 2-word long-immediate
move), so a branch that happens to jump exactly 12 words forward is
indistinguishable, to a raw word scan, from a real standalone `rts`. This
went undetected for many sessions because no prior branch's displacement
ever happened to collide -- until this session's KEY FLT HP re-entry
declick added `bra zz08` with a displacement of exactly 12, which silently
shifted every later rts index by one and pointed `moncommit`'s computed
address into the MIDDLE of zz18's body instead of moncommit's real entry.
Caught only because emu_sc_dsp3_moncommit.py failed after a full rebuild --
NOT by the existing round-trip disassembly check (which only rejects
invalid opcodes, not wrong addresses) -- so this would have gone to
hardware wired wrong had the moncommit test not been re-run post-edit.

Fix: find `rts` from the DISASSEMBLER's own parsed instruction boundaries
(it already knows a 2-word instruction's second word is an operand, not a
new opcode), not by scanning raw words.
