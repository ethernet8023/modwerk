|  SIDE-CHAIN COMPRESSOR  --  step 1 of 4: menu only (the DSP still
|  ignores every new parameter; this proves the ColdFire control-surface
|  side + the dynamic KEY formatter on real hardware).
|
|  Adds  KEY  to the COMPRESSOR effect page 2 (parameter-descriptor slot
|  7, right after RMS).  Value semantics (Session 77, cross-core SIDECHAIN --
|  widened from the original 0..4 "same-core siblings only" range once the
|  DSP side could reach any track, see NOTES.md "Session 77"):
|      0        = OFF  (stock behaviour: the compressor keys off its own
|                       track, unchanged)
|      1 .. 8   = track T1..T8, ANY of the eight tracks, flat -- same value
|                 on both payloads, no longer relative to the edited track's
|                 own DSP core. Value count 5->9 in build_sidechain_compressor.py's own
|                 SLOTS table.
|
|  Everything except this formatter is a data poke done by
|  build_sidechain.py (name / value-count 2->5 / default 1->0 / the
|  A-array formatter pointer / zero the stale B-array widget pointer).

|  No link frame (matches the stock per-slot formatters, e.g. FUN_4003c14c
|  ON/OFF and FUN_4003c718 "%d").  Stack on entry:
|      0(%sp) = return addr   4(%sp) = buf   8(%sp) = value
|  Convention: %d0/%d1/%a0/%a1 are scratch; %d2+ must be preserved
|  (FUN_4003c7a0 saves %d2), so this routine touches only %d0/%d1/%a1.

|  picker, so the value on the stack already IS the track number to print.

|  (0x40046450, list-style "OFF"/"T1".."T4" renderer, see build_sidechain_compressor.py's
|  LIST_FN) into its simple single-centered-value mode instead of its
|  3-row scroll-preview mode.
|
|  Disassembled 0x40046450 in full (Session 76 continued yet again (8)):
|  its 5th stack argument (a caller-supplied flags word, read into %d5 at
|  the callee's own +68(%sp) after its own -48 frame -- i.e. at +20(%sp)
|  as seen from HERE, before that frame exists) has bit 1 as an internal
|  mode switch:
|      bit1 SET    -> measuretext once, drawtext the formatted value
|                      (from the SAME buffer key_fmt already filled)
|                      CENTERED on one line. Exactly "name + value", no
|                      icon -- this is what real stock LFO TRIG must get
|                      from its own (unlocated) caller.
|      bit1 CLEAR  -> a second branch that formats/measures/draws THREE
|                      separate rows (a fresh, uninitialised second
|                      buffer at one of them) -- this is the garbage
|                      3-line render COMPRESSOR's own generic per-slot
|                      dispatcher drives us into, for reasons not fully
|                      traced (its caller-context builder was not found
|                      despite two dedicated passes -- background agent +
|                      direct).
|  Two dedicated tracing passes couldn't find WHERE that flags word
|  originates, so rather than reproduce the caller's own setup, this
|  trampoline just patches the one bit we need on the stack in place
|  before falling straight into the real function -- same return address,
|  same argument layout, LIST_FN re-reads its own (now-corrected) copy.
|  d0/d1/a0/a1 scratch per the same convention key_fmt/kfilt_fmt rely on
|  (LIST_FN's own %moveml saves d2-d6/a2-a5, not d0/d1/a0/a1).
