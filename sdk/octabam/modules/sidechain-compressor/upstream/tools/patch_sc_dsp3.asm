; SIDE-CHAIN COMPRESSOR -- step 3 DSP code.
;
; Superset of tools/patch_sc_dsp.asm (step 2).  Same two detour sites in the
; stock payload (dispatcher FX1 entry -> sctap ; COMPRESSOR proc+0 -> scdet)
; plus a THIRD hook at COMPRESSOR proc-end -> sctail for SC LISTEN.
;
; New page-2 controls the DSP acts on (packing = octabam PARAM_PAGES;
; emu_sc_dsp3.py -params index in parens):
;   KEY      x:(r6+$d) bits 16-23   0..8    OFF / any of T1..T8, flat  (8)
;   KEY FLT  x:(r6+$d) bits  8-15   0..127  64=bypass  <64 LP  >64 HP  (9)
;   KEY GAIN x:(r6+$e) bits 16-23   0..127  64=unity  ~+/-24 dB        (10)
;   SC LISTN x:(r6+$e) bits  8-15   0..1    OFF / ON  (audition key)   (11)
; KEY's range widened 0..4 -> 0..8 in Session 77 (cross-core SIDECHAIN,
; NOTES.md): it now names an absolute track T1..T8 directly, same value on
; both payloads, rather than "one of this track's own 4 same-core siblings"
; -- @KADJ@ (the old per-payload relative-offset token) is retired.
;
; dsp_asm quirks (see patch_sc_dsp.asm header): no directives / constants /
; jmp / jcc -- literals only, labels substituted textually (raw substring, so
; every label here is `zzNN`, all 4 chars, all distinct => none is a prefix of
; another), every routine ends `rts` (the build hand-encodes `jsr <cave>` at
; each site, control returns via rts).  Build tokens, rewritten per payload:
;   the KEY GAIN table's base -- the one 6-hex-digit `fab1e0` literal below
;            (octabam's ptable marker, so it appears nowhere else in this file):
;            absolute P addr of the 16-word KEY GAIN table (gain/64, Q23); the
;            32-word KEY FLT table (a = 1-exp(-2pi fc/fs), Q23) follows it
;   FTAB_R1 (the token at zz06, in @s)  r1 = the KEY FLT table: `move #>FTAB,r1` (the standalone
;            builder, unchanged bytes), or `lua (r1+$10),r1` from the KEY GAIN
;            base still in r1 (octabam: one table literal; r1 is not written
;            between the two reads, and the KEY GAIN read runs on every path
;            to zz06)
;   @LPEDGE@ literal Q23 immediate, LP's near-OFF edge-override coefficient
;   @HPEDGE@ literal Q23 immediate, HP's near-OFF edge-override coefficient
;   @KGNA@   literal Q23 immediate, KEY GAIN's block-rate smoothing coefficient
; The tables are appended after the code by build_sidechain_compressor.py; both table addresses
; are resolved in a first sizing pass so the `move #>imm` widths never shift.
; @LPEDGE@/@HPEDGE@ are plain literal substitutions (tools/sc_tables.py's
; lp_edge()/hp_edge()), not addresses -- fixed width regardless of pass.
;
; Cross-core tokens (Session 77, NOTES.md has the full design writeup):
;   @COREBASE@   this core's own base track index: 4 (payload A, tracks 5-8)
;                / 0 (payload B, tracks 1-4)
;   @FCOREBASE@  the FOREIGN core's base track index: the other one of the
;                pair above
;   @SBASE@      this core's OWN publish region in the shared window:
;                $33e00 (payload A) / $3be00 (payload B) -- where sctap
;                writes so the FOREIGN core can read.  Session 115 moved it
;                from $30100/$38100: those are 256 words into the stock FX2
;                slot of bank track 3 (T7 / T3), i.e. INSIDE a reverb's delay
;                lines -- every track's audio was being written into DARK/PLATE
;                REVERB's memory on that core (NOTES.md "Session 114 continued
;                (4)").  The new block is the last $200 words of the same
;                16K slot: stock DSP code never writes past slot+$3da2 (DARK
;                REVERB's last line, measured and read from its init; PLATE
;                stops near +$3577, every FX1-capable effect below +$c00, the
;                DELAY runs on the ColdFire), and each payload's own init
;                zeroes its half of the window at boot.
;   @FSBASE@     the FOREIGN core's publish region: the other one of the
;                pair above -- where scdet reads a foreign KEY selection from
;   @GCNT@       this core's own generation counter, one word, in the shared
;                window right before its own @SBASE@ block: $33dff (A) /
;                $3bdff (B). Never read the FOREIGN core's copy of this --
;                each core tracks its OWN belief about "what generation is
;                everyone on right now" and assumes the two agree (XBUS's own
;                rule, inherited along with its caveat: this assumes the two
;                cores are rate-locked, unverified, see NOTES.md)
;   @GSEED@      this core's own "have I ever seeded @GCNT@" sentinel word,
;                right before @GCNT@: $33dfe (A) / $3bdfe (B)
;   @FOREIGN_BR@ "beq zzXX" (payload A) / "bne zzXX" (payload B) -- branches
;                to the foreign-core read path when a track-membership test
;                (`and #>4,acc`, uniform on both payloads) says this KEY
;                selection is NOT on this core's own half
; Shared-window layout: 4 tracks x 4 generations x 32 words = $200 (512)
; words per core, `slot(local_track, gen) = SBASE + local_track*$80 +
; (gen&3)*$20`. No accumulation
; (each publish wholly overwrites its own slot), so unlike XBUS's bus there
; is no clear-vs-write race and no housekeeper election needed -- only the
; write-vs-read race, guarded the same way XBUS's is: four buffers, reader
; always two generations behind the writer.
;
; keybus (Y, this core's private memory; Session 115 layout):
;   slot(track) = $800 + track*$40, track = ABSOLUTE 0..7, so $800..$9ff:
;     +$00..$1f  gen 0 = the per-frame publish (sctap) -- only this core's
;                own 4 tracks are ever written here
;     +$20..$3f  gen 1 = the SC LISTEN stash -- scdet writes the *processed*
;                key there (indexed by the SOURCE track, any of 0..7),
;                moncommit copies it to the dry buffer
;   MON_ON/MON_KEY[track] = Y:$7f0 + track*2 (+0 / +1), $7f0..$7ff.
;   Until Session 115 this was $800 + track*$80 with MON at +$40/$41, i.e.
;   $a00..$bff on payload A (tracks 5-8) -- exactly where REPITCH keeps its
;   per-track RPSP ring and SP table (Y:$a00.., tools/repitch_dsp_src.py), so
;   the combined image overwrote REPITCH's state on tracks 5-8 every block.
;   Y:$795..$fff is free on stock on both cores (measured; payload B's modules
;   end at $7a4), and REPITCH owns $a00..$fff: SIDE-CHAIN now stays in
;   $7f0..$9ff.
;   This is SAME-CORE-ONLY and unaffected by cross-core KEY (see the design
;   note above scdet's r5 computation); only its addresses moved.
;
; One-pole tracker state, per compressor instance, in the compressor's own r7
; block at r7+$16 -- unused by the stock module (RE: state block r7+$f..$1b;
; disassembly of the real init routine at P:0x1864 confirms it zero-fills
; only $11/$12/$13/$1a/$1b/$f, leaving $14/$16/$17/$18 untouched and
; therefore NOT guaranteed zero -- whatever DSP memory held before this
; track's compressor instance was assigned lands there unchanged). r7+$18 is
; OUR OWN dedicated "have I ever seeded the tracker myself" latch (never
; touched by stock or by any other hook here): do not gate on the stock
; "first-block" bit (r7+$f) instead -- it can legitimately go warm from
; ordinary stock activity before our KEY FLT code has ever run once (e.g.
; KFLT parked at bypass for a while, then turned to LP/HP for the first
; time), which would otherwise seed the tracker from garbage at $16.
; r7+$17 (the old 2-pole SVF's "bp" integrator, Sessions before 76) was
; retired by the one-pole redesign and is reclaimed below as the KEY GAIN
; smoother's own persisted state (see "-- KEY GAIN --"). r7+$14 is a second
; reclaimed word -- a one-shot "the previous block was OFF" flag consumed by
; KEY FLT's HP branch only (see "-- KEY FLT --"); flagged as a free
; candidate slot two sessions ago, used here for exactly the purpose floated
; then.
;
; AUDIT THE OUTPUT BY DISASSEMBLY.  No `mpy x0,y0` (assembles as mpysu) --
; only x1,x0 / x1,y0 operand orders, which emit true signed mpy.
; ===========================================================================

; ---- HOOK 1 : publish tap (same-core keybus unchanged from step 2; extended
; Session 77 with a cross-core publish into the shared window) -------------
; Clobber budget for THIS splice (audited, step 2's own header): stock
; reloads a,b,r0,r1,n1,x0 right after each rejoin -- everything added below
; stays strictly within that set, on purpose (this hook runs unconditionally
; for every track every block, the hottest path in this whole file, so an
; unaudited register here has a much bigger blast radius than anything in
; scdet, which only runs for tracks actually using COMPRESSOR).
;
; Cross-core design (NOTES.md "Session 77" has the full reasoning): every
; track sctap ever sees IS one of this core's own 4 tracks (a core's own
; dispatcher only ever dispatches its own tracks), so there is no same/
; foreign branch needed here at all -- every call publishes.  Unlike XBUS's
; accumulator bus, there is nothing to CLEAR (each track's slot is wholly
; overwritten every publish, never summed), so no housekeeper election is
; needed either -- just a per-core generation counter, advanced once per
; block, gated on "this is core-local track 0" (@COREBASE@ itself), which is
; a STRUCTURAL condition (some track always dispatches first; sctap already
; runs for it unconditionally) rather than an elected one.

; -- KEY GAIN : x:(r6+$e) bits 16-23, 0..127 ; 64 = unity --
; Session 76 continued yet again (KGN smoothing): applying the raw table
; gain uniformly across the block produced an instantaneous STEP in x:$40
; every time a knob sweep crossed a table-bucket boundary -- inaudible with
; MON off (x:$40 only feeds the DETECTOR there, and the compressor's own
; attack/release ballistics smooth whatever the detector sees before it
; ever reaches the target track's actual audio), but MON's audition path
; (moncommit, HOOK 3) plays x:$40 AS the committed track audio with zero
; smoothing of its own -- every bucket crossing was an audible click while
; riding the knob with MON on. Fix: smooth the APPLIED gain itself with a
; one-pole, coefficient-weighted-feedback tracker -- same principle as KEY
; FLT's tracker below, applied to a scalar coefficient instead of the audio,
; updated once per call (block-rate; the target changes at most once per
; 16-sample block, so per-sample resolution buys nothing here). Persistent
; state: r7+$17, the old 2-pole SVF's retired "bp" integrator slot (free
; since the Session 76 KFLT redesign -- see this file's own header). 0 is
; used as the "never seeded" sentinel -- gain_table()'s entries are all
; strictly positive (even -24 dB is a small positive Q23 value), so a
; genuine table value can never collide with it; a fresh/reassigned
; compressor instance therefore snaps straight to the target on its first
; KEY GAIN block instead of smoothing in from meaningless garbage.
; The old exact-unity (KGAIN==64) bypass skip is gone: table idx 8 (KGAIN
; 64-71, see sc_tables.py gain_table()) already stores a true 1.0
; multiplier, so folding it into the same smoothed path is free -- and

; -- KEY FLT : x:(r6+$d) bits 8-15, 0..127 ; 64 = bypass ; <64 LP ; >64 HP --
; Session 76 continued (third pass): ONE-POLE tracker, not the old 2-pole
; Chamberlin SVF. Single state var (r7+$16, "tracker"), single coefficient
; (x1, Q23 "a"): tracker += a*(in - tracker); LP output = tracker; HP output
; = in - tracker (n0 marks LP vs HP for the per-sample select, same as
; before). r7+$17 (the old "bp" integrator) is no longer used by this cave.
;
; WHY: the previous two attempts at a click-free OFF boundary both failed on
; hardware -- a dry/wet amplitude blend near OFF corrupted the REAL
; compressor's own detector (comb-filtering a signal against a phase-shifted
; copy of itself, read continuously by an envelope follower -> audible ring
; modulation on the TARGET track, not just a click); a wider version of the
; same blend would only have spread that same corruption further, not fixed
; it (NOTES.md, this session). The fix isn't a wider or smoother blend --
; it's a topology whose FEEDBACK is coefficient-weighted. This one-pole
; system's only feedback term is `a*(in-tracker)`: at a=0 the tracker never
; moves (frozen); at a's Q23 ceiling the tracker becomes `in` itself, EVERY
; sample, with NO dependence on its own history -- unlike the old SVF, where
; `hp = in - lp - 2*bp` used `lp`/`bp` UNWEIGHTED, so stale state mattered
; at full strength no matter how small the tuning coefficient got. A single
; real pole also can't resonate (no q parameter needed, no discriminant to
; satisfy, no "q >= 1.688" hardware-forced tuning like the old SVF needed --
; Session 64's ringing bug straightforwardly cannot recur here), AND a
; one-pole coefficient in [0, Q23-ceiling] is unconditionally stable -- no
; upper bound like the old SVF's q=2 hit around ~5-6 kHz when pushed toward
; a bright/transparent LP setting (worked out, not shipped, two sessions
; ago). That headroom is what lets LP's near-OFF step target genuine near-
; unity instead of a compromise value.
;
; THE EDGE OVERRIDE (not a blend -- a coefficient choice, one signal, always):
; FTAB's normal 40-2200 Hz curve (unchanged, same shape as every prior
; session) is shared by both LP (idx 0..31, low->high freq) and HP (idx
; 0..31, low->high freq) -- so FTAB[31] (2200 Hz) is also HP's own deepest
; setting, and FTAB[0] (40 Hz) is also LP's own deepest setting; pushing
; either toward "transparent" in the table itself would detune the OTHER
; mode's tuned end. Instead: idx==31 in the LP branch and idx==0 in the HP
; branch each get a ONE-TIME coefficient override (checked once per call,
; before the loop even starts -- zero per-sample cost) instead of the normal
; FTAB fetch. LP's override is the Q23 ceiling (~unity, as close to a true
; identity tracker as this format allows). HP's is ~8 Hz -- can't reach LP's
; exact-identity limit (a highpass, even at its most transparent, still has
; to track something to subtract; that's what "highpass" means, not a defect
; of this design) but is slow and small enough that any residual error from
; reusing whatever the tracker last held decays gently, not abruptly -- the
; user's own real-hardware anecdote (stock FILTER's BASE control audibly
; reaching transparent in a single raw-value step, 126->127) is the same
; principle: the LAST step near an extreme doesn't need to be gradual if the
; coefficient it lands on is inherently well-behaved.

; SIDECHAIN3 split-detector-offset bug (found this session, investigating a
; real reported artifact -- an alternating loud/quiet pattern between
; consecutive pattern loops, tracking exactly the loop length's own phase
; drift against the 16-sample DSP block grid). This redirect used to set
; r0 := $40 unconditionally, discarding whatever offset the CALLER's own r0
; held on entry -- correct for the frame's only/first call (n6, our saved
; copy of that entry r0, is always 0 there), but WRONG for a mid-block
; split's SECOND call, where n6 = split*2 (the dispatcher's own offset into
; the real audio buffer marking where the newly-triggered voice's segment
; begins -- see the header comment above, "SIDECHAIN3 ringing bug, take 2").
; x:$40 mirrors the WHOLE 16-sample-pair block 1:1 (that same prior fix
; specifically guarantees every pair is valid regardless of split), so the
; correct redirect for BOTH calls is $40+n6, not a bare $40 -- confirmed by
; a direct dsp_host register dump before writing this fix: simulating a
; split second call (incoming r0=$a) left r0=$40 instead of the correct
; $4a, i.e. stock's detector re-read the FIRST part of the block's key

; ---- HOOK 3 : dispatcher-level MON commit (replaces the old proc-end splice)
; Spliced at the per-track COMMIT step in the DISPATCHER itself (payload A:
; P:0x50e, payload B: P:0x303 -- both `move x:>$206,r0`, reading this track's
; per-track output-slot pointer immediately before its copy-to-output-slot
; call). This runs strictly AFTER this track's entire FX1+FX2 processing --
; including all of the compressor's own envelope/gain math -- has already
; returned to the dispatcher, sharing NO execution context or timing with it.
; Reads the flag `scdet` published this same frame and, if set, overwrites
; X:0 (this track's about-to-be-committed audio) with a fresh re-fetch of
; keybus[key] gen 1 -- not a value carried across the compressor's own call.
;
; REGISTER DISCIPLINE (Session 59, hardware-forced): `r0` holds the just-
; replayed `x:$206` and MUST reach the stock `jsr func_00034f` right after us
; UNCHANGED -- unlike r1/n1/r3 (all explicitly overwritten by the three stock
; instructions between this splice and that call: `move #$0,r1` / `move #$1,
; n1` / `move x:>$419,r3`), nothing resets r0 for us, so it is never touched
; again below. A first version additionally used r2/n2 as scratch for the
; second address computation -- neither is reset by that intervening stock
; code, and using them broke the sequencer transport outright on real
; hardware. Reuse r1/n1 for the second lookup instead (safe by the same
; "the very next stock instructions overwrite it anyway" logic) and route the
; output through r3 (also explicitly reset next) -- do not reintroduce r2/n2
; or touch r0 here without a fresh hardware test.
;
; UNINITIALIZED-SLOT HAZARD (found post-Session-59-flash: transport still
; broken with the register fix alone): this hook runs for EVERY track's
; commit, every frame -- but Y:0x800+track*0x80+0x40 (MON_ON) is only ever
; WRITTEN by `scdet`, which only runs for the one track actively processing a
; COMPRESSOR. For every other track this slot is real, never-zeroed DSP
; memory: dumping the actual baseline .mem (tools/emu_sc_dsp3_moncommit.py's
; own MEM_B) shows EVERY track's slot already holds large nonzero garbage
; (~0x7fffff-ish, i.e. Q23-scale audio residue, not silence) even before any
; of this project's code runs. A plain `tst b` ("nonzero = on") is true for
; essentially all of that garbage, so on real hardware this hook fires for
; nearly every non-compressor track on nearly every frame, deriving a source
; address from garbage MON_KEY and overwriting that track's committed audio
; from it -- a very plausible cause of DSP-side chaos severe enough to take
; the sequencer transport down (the same failure CLASS Session 59 already
; proved: DSP state disturbance desyncing something transport-critical),
; independent of the register-clobber bug already fixed there. Fix: gate on
; the EXACT sentinel `scdet` publishes for ON, not "nonzero" -- `move #1,b`'s
; left-aligned short-immediate quirk (q2, top of file) means that sentinel is
; actually `$10000`, not `1`; matching it exactly by chance is not plausible
; for garbage in this value range (the dumped baseline's own garbage sits in
; the millions, Q23-audio-scale, nowhere near $10000 = 65536).
