Side-chain step-3 DSP coefficient tables -- shared by build_sidechain_compressor.py and
emu_sc_dsp3.py so the two never drift.

Both tables are 24-bit words appended to the assembled cave (patch_sc_dsp3.asm)
by the build; the .asm reads them with `move p:(r1+n1),x1` at @GTAB@ / @FTAB@.

KEY GAIN  (16 entries, index = KGAIN >> 3, KGAIN 0..127, 64 = unity)
  stored value = (gain / 64) in Q23, so the cave does  mpy ; asl #6  -> * gain.
  gain law: dB = (KGAIN - 64) * (24 / 64)  ->  ~ +/-24 dB, ~3 dB per index step.

  KGN_SMOOTH (Session 76 continued yet again): a knob sweep crosses these
  ~3 dB table buckets one at a time, and applying the raw target uniformly
  across a 16-sample block produced an audible click at every crossing when
  MON was on (MON plays x:$40 directly as the committed track audio, no
  smoothing of its own -- see patch_sc_dsp3.asm's "-- KEY GAIN --" header).
  Fix: a one-pole, coefficient-weighted-feedback smoother on the APPLIED
  gain itself (not the audio), updated once per call/block. kgn_smooth_a()
  is that coefficient in Q23, from a real time constant (KGN_SMOOTH_MS)
  rather than a guessed raw value, so its meaning stays legible and it's
  trivially re-tunable in one place.

KEY FLT  (32 entries, exp-spaced cutoff FC_LO..FC_HI)
  stored value = a = 1 - exp(-2*pi*fc/FS)  in Q23 (Session 76 continued,
  3rd pass -- one-pole EMA tracker: tracker += a*(in-tracker); LP output =
  tracker, HP output = in-tracker. Replaces the old 2-pole Chamberlin SVF --
  see patch_sc_dsp3.asm's KEY FLT header for why: a one-pole's feedback is
  coefficient-weighted, so it can reach genuine near-unity at LP's edge with
  no q/stability ceiling, unlike the old SVF).
  LP: index = KFLT >> 1            (KFLT 0..63  -> fc FC_LO..FC_HI, 0 = tightest)
  HP: index = (KFLT - 64) >> 1     (KFLT 65..127 -> fc FC_LO..FC_HI)

KEY FLT edge overrides (not table entries -- literals patched into the .asm
via @LPEDGE@/@HPEDGE@, checked once per call, before the loop): FTAB[31]
(2200 Hz) is also HP's own deepest setting and FTAB[0] (40 Hz) is also LP's
own deepest setting -- shared table, can't push either toward "transparent"
without detuning the other mode's tuned end. So the LP/HP step closest to
OFF (idx 31 / idx 0) skips the FTAB fetch entirely and uses these instead:
  LP_EDGE = Q23 ceiling (~unity, closest this format allows to a true
            identity tracker -- always stable for a one-pole, no ceiling).
  HP_EDGE = a at ~8 Hz (near-DC; a highpass can't reach true identity even
            at its most transparent -- it must always track something to
            subtract -- but this is slow/small enough that reusing stale
            tracker state decays gently rather than snapping).
