"""SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR -- stock COMPRESSOR with a side-chain KEY from any track.

    page 2  RMS (stock, slot 6), then
            KEY   OFF / T1..T8: the track whose audio drives the detector
            KFLT  the key's filter: 64 = bypass, below = low-pass, above = high-pass
            KGN   the key's gain, about -24..+24 dB around 64
            MON   ON = hear the processed key instead of the track (audition)

Hardware-confirmed in this octabam form (the author's MKI, 2026-10-04; see MEASURED).

COLDFIRE. One ROM unit, sc_cf (tools/patch_sidechain.s, 134 B): KEY's and KFLT's
formatters and KEY's list widget. The page-2 slots are written as raw descriptor words
(Param.formatter_word / widget_word), as the standalone builder writes them: this unit's
symbols for KEY's formatter and widget and KFLT's formatter, stock's bipolar formatter
for KGN and ON/OFF formatter and switch for MON, and widget 0 (a plain knob) for KFLT
and KGN.

DSP. MenuEntry(replaces="COMPRESSOR", stock_dsp=True): the effect IS stock COMPRESSOR,
its dispatch entry untouched. This module's code runs from three DspHooks, at different
addresses on the two payloads:
    sctap      dispatcher, every track every block: publish the track's audio to this
               core's keybus (core-private Y) and to the cross-core window
    scdet      COMPRESSOR proc+0: replace the detector input with the KEY track's audio,
               through KGN and KFLT; stash it for MON
    moncommit  dispatcher, per-track commit: with MON on, the stashed key replaces the
               track's output
The per-core values (own and foreign core base, the window addresses, the branch
sense) come from DspSection.subst; the 16 + 32 table words are one ptable, read at the
KEY GAIN site through the source's single base literal and at the KEY FLT site as
`lua (r1+$10),r1` + `nop` from that same base (r1 is not written between the two reads).

CLAIMS. Core-private Y $7f0-$9ff (MON words, keybus) on both cores, and the last $202
words of each core's half of the shared window (A $33dfe.., B $3bdfe..). BusDelay and
BusVerb use that window, so the ledger refuses this module beside them: a later version
moves the window.

MEASURED. The ColdFire unit, linked at the standalone image's own address, is that
image's bytes (5407 and 54455 alike). The DSP source is the standalone's
(tools/patch_sc_dsp3.asm), with the same per-core values; octabam assembles and places
it itself: on both payloads its code is the standalone's instruction for instruction except
the two table loads, and the 48 table words are identical. On the author's MKI, this octabam
form (2026-10-04, with all six KYOTI modules and REC_TRIG_MUTE): COMPRESSOR's two pages,
KEY ducking on one core and across cores both ways, KFLT, KGN, MON, no reverb cross-talk on
T7, a muted KEY in each MUTE MODE and the first kick after PLAY. Before that, the standalone
and KYOTI V1.0: KEY ducking, MON, a muted KEY with MUTE_MODES.
