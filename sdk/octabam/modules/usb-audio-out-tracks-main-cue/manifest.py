"""USB AUDIO OUT TRACKS MAIN CUE -- the unit as a UAC2 audio input, 20 channels at 44.1 kHz 24-bit.

High speed: the eight tracks' L/R (post-FX, pre-fader) on channels 1-16,
MAIN on 17-18, CUE on 19-20. Full speed: the tracks' stereo sum.
markandrus (octemu, MIT); MAIN/CUE Bryan T. A DRAM unit with build-time
detours. Needs USB MIDI: the audio function joins its composite, and the
ISR shim chains to USB MIDI's through octabam's receive shim (usbmidi_rx.s,
which timestamps each MIDI clock byte for the tempo). README.md has the
design and what was measured. USB AUDIO OUT TRACKS (modules/usb-audio-out-tracks, the sixteen track
channels) and USB AUDIO OUT MASTER (modules/usb-audio-out-master, track 8's two)
assemble the same source with another USB_LAYOUT.
