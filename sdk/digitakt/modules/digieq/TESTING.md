# Digi EQ testing

## In Modwerk

Nothing has been flashed or tested on hardware in Modwerk. Evidence tier: `none`.

Modwerk’s vendored elekloader builder linked and verified a build of this mod with core 2.1 on each OS release it is built for:

- OS 1.53: built and verified with core 2.1 and digieq 1.0b; the result’s SHA-256 begins `c2017f90d663d012`.
- OS 1.54: built and verified with core 2.1 and digieq 1.0b; the result’s SHA-256 begins `b8f0663db01791b4`.

This is a build check against the owner’s stock files, kept locally, not a hardware test. The built images stay on the owner’s computer.

## Upstream

Its author reports Digi EQ 1.0b is not yet tested on a unit; it passes their emulator tests on OS 1.53 and 1.54. Their documentation describes those checks: `tests/emu_eq.py` checks the knobs against the design model, the audio bit for bit against it, and the settings in the kit and the global override; `tests/digiemu_eq.py` boots the firmware and measures a test tone put into the master mix again in the bus the USB stream is built from, against what the model says the settings should do. For 1.0b the author also reports a firmware round trip: settings written, project saved, RAM wiped and project loaded, with all bytes back and the EQ playing them. Their risk table asks owners to check once on the unit, after a power cycle, that a pattern’s EQ came back.

The author documents their checks in [upstream/REPOSITORY.md](upstream/REPOSITORY.md) and in the repository’s [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/gdeo607/digi1_mods/blob/35bacb3730d108e4dc48a7bd6de4c99ae9b161e6/CHANGELOG.md) and [RISKS.md](https://github.com/gdeo607/digi1_mods/blob/35bacb3730d108e4dc48a7bd6de4c99ae9b161e6/RISKS.md). Those results belong to the author’s 1.0b builds with elekloader’s toolchain and core; they do not qualify a Modwerk build.

## Imported memory estimate

The author’s `digieq-1.0b.elemod` release object for OS 1.53 (SHA-256 `af5088bf444de4f1c269e56151805e196277568a96645cf216fc947091162969`) contains 8,522 B in `.run`, 564 B in `.bss` and 4 B of table contributions: **9,090 B** in total.

The author’s `digieq-1.0b-os1.54.elemod` release object for OS 1.54 (SHA-256 `82dcd78faf44e67bc7fd0920266bb122583bd60288c1dd03fa878b6f3f9301a0`) contains 8,522 B in `.run`, 564 B in `.bss` and 4 B of table contributions: **9,090 B** in total.

This counts code, initialized data, zero-filled state and contributions, not the JSON file size. It excludes the shared Modwerk core and linker alignment; the browser estimate reserves those separately. This is an upstream object measurement, not a measured Modwerk build or hardware load report.
